# Software Architecture

## :round_pushpin: Introduction
`Software Architecture` refers to the fundametal organization of a software system and the key principles and decisions that guide its design and development. It encompasses the high-level structure of a software system and defines the components, relationships, and interactions between them.

It can be thought of as the blueprint for a software system, laying out the overall structure and design of the system before any code is written. It involves identifying the key components of the system, defining their responsibilities and interactions, and specifying the interfaces and protocols that govern how they communicate.

It is critical for building large, complex software systems that are *reliable*, *maintainable*, and *scalable*. It helps ensure the system is designed to meet the needs of its users and stakeholders, and that it can evolve and adapt over time as requirements change.

Software architecture is a board and multifaceted field, encompassing many approaches and methodologies. Some common architectural styles include `layered architecture`, `client-server architecture`, `microservices architecture`, and `event-driven architecture`. There are more.
