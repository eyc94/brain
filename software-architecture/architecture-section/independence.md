## :round_pushpin: Introduction
A good architecture must support:
- The use cases and operation of the system.
- The maintenance of the system.
- The development of the system.
- The deployment of the system.

## :round_pushpin: Use Cases
The architecture of the system **must** support the intent of the system.

If system is a shopping cart app, the architecture must support shopping cart use cases.

However, architecture does not wield much influence over the behavior of the system. Architecture should clarify and expose behavior so the intent of the system is visible at the architectural level.

A shopping cart app with a good architecture will *look* like a shopping cart app. Developers do not have to hunt for behaviors because the behaviors will be first-class elements at the top level. They will have functions and classes with clear names that describe what they do.
