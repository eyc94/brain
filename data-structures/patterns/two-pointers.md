## :round_pushpin: Introduction
In problems with an array or linked list, we are often asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.

Take a look at this problem:
```
Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size 'K' in it.

Example:
Array: [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2], K = 5
```
