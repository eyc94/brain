## :round_pushpin: Summary
- Node-based binary tree.

## :round_pushpin: Properties
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys *lesser* than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys *greater* than the node's key.
- The left and right subtrees each must also be a binary search tree.
- No duplicate values.
  - Some implementations allow it.
