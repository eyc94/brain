# Graph

## Summary
- Non-linear data structure.
- Consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges.
- Edges connect pairs of nodes.
- Hierarchical.
- Arranged in a tree-like strcture.
- Top-most node is called the `root` node.

## Characteristics
- Max distance from a vertex to all other vertices is the `Eccentricity` of that vertex.
- Vertex with minimum eccentricity is considered the central point of the graph.
- The minimum value of `Eccentricity` is considered the radius of a connected graph.
