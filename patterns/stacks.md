## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- A `Stack` is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
- The order is `LIFO (last in first out)`.
- See [Stack](../data-structures/linear/stack/stack.md) data structure for more information.

## :round_pushpin: Example
- Infix/postfix
- Reversal
- Tower of Hanoi
- Tree Traversals
- Histograms
- Undo/redo operations
