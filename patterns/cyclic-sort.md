## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- Problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.

## :round_pushpin: Examples
```
You are given an unsorted array containing numbers taken from the range 1 to 'n'. The array can have duplicates, which means that some numbers will be missing. Find all missing numbers.
```

- You can use the fact that the input array contains numbers in the range of 1 to `n`.
- We can try to sort the numbers.
- We can then iterate the array to find all indices that are missing the correct numbers.
