## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- A lot of problems deal with `Permutations` and `Combinations` of a given set of elements.
- A subset pattern is an `Breadth First Search (BFS)` approach to handle all these problems.

## :round_pushpin: Requirements
- Usually can tell if there's backtracking of some sort involved.
