## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- A `Trie` is a k-ary search tree used for storing and searching a specific key from a set.
- Using Trie, search complexities are brought to the optimal limit (key length).
- If we store keys in a Binary Search Tree, a well-balanced BST will need time proportional to `M * log N`, where `M` is the max string length and `N` is the number of keys in the tree.
- Using a Trie, the key can be searched in `O(M)` time.
- The penalty of a Trie is the Trie storage requirements.
- See notes on [Trie](../data-structures/non-linear/tree/trie.md) for more details.
