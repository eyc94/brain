## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- This pattern is based on the `Breadth First Search (BFS)` technique to traverse a tree.
- Use a `Queue` data structure to keep track of all nodes of a level before we jump to the next level.
- Space complexity will be `O(W)` where `W` is the max number of nodes on any level.

## :round_pushpin: Requirements
- Problems that involve traversing a tree level by level can solved efficiently using this approach.
