## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- A data structure that keeps track of a set of elements *partitioned* into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
- Also called `Disjoint-Set Data Structure` or `Union-Find Data Structure`.
- Stores a collection of disjoint sets.
- It stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
- Provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets, and finding a representative member of a set.

## :round_pushpin: Operations
A `Union-Find Algorithm` is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:
  1. **Find:** Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
  2. **Union:** Join two subsets into a single subset. First we have to check if two subsets belong to the same set. If not, we cannot perform union.
