## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- Also known as the `Hare & Tortoise Algorithm`.
- Pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/linked list) at different speeds.
- Useful for cycle detection.
- Basically, moving at two different speeds guarantees that the two pointers will meet.
- Famous problem is finding a cycle in a linked list.

## :round_pushpin: Requirements
- Usually is represented as a sequence of something.

## :round_pushpin: Types
- Cycle detection.
