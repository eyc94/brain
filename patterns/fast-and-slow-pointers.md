## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- Also known as the `Hare & Tortoise Algorithm`.
- Similar to the `Two Pointers Algorithm`.
  - Traverse the iterable data structure at different speeds.
- Pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/linked list) at different speeds.
  - Generally, the fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow.
- Useful for cycle detection.
- Basically, moving at two different speeds guarantees that the two pointers will meet.
- Famous problem is finding a cycle in a linked list.
- Used to determine data structure traits using indices in arrays or node pointers in linked lists.
- You can think of two runners on the track where one is faster than the other. They are bound to overlap.

## :round_pushpin: Requirements
- Usually used to identify distinguishable features of directional data structures, such as a linked list or an array.

## :round_pushpin: Types
- Cycle detection.
