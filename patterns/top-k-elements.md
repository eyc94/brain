## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent `K` elements among a given set falls under this pattern.
- Best data structure is the `Heap`.

## :round_pushpin: Requirements
- Problem asks for top, smallest, or frequent elements.

## :round_pushpin: Leetcode Problems ![1/14 = 7%](https://progress-bar.dev/7)
- [x] 215. [Kth Largest Element in an Array (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)
  - We can utilize a `Min Heap` or a `Max Heap`.
- [ ] 230. [Kth Smallest Element in a BST (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)
  - I included this here because it can be a heap problem and can be other tree related traversal algorithm problem.
