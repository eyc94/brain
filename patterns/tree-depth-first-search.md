## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- Based on the `Depth First Search (DFS)` technique to traverse a tree.
- Using recursion (or can have stack).
- The space complexity is `O(H)` where `H` is the maximum height of the tree.

## :round_pushpin: Requirements
- Calculating the accumulation of something.
- Usually involves a path.
