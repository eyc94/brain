## :round_pushpin: Introduction
- General algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem.
- Solves problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

## :round_pushpin: Examples
Three types of problems in backtracking:
  1. **Decision Problem:** We search for a feasible solution.
  2. **Optimization Problem:** We search for the best solution.
  3. **Enumeration Problem:** We find all feasible solutions.

Examples:
- Sudoku
- Matrices
