## :round_pushpin: Data Structures
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. An efficient data structure utilizes minimum memory space and execution time.

There are two classifications of data structures:

### Linear
Elements are arranged in one dimension.
- [Array](./data-structures/linear/array/array.md)
  - [Java ArrayList class](./data-structures/linear/array/java-arraylist.md)
- [Linked List](./data-structures/linear/linked-list/linked-list.md)
  - [Java LinkedList class](./data-structures/linear/linked-list/java-linkedlist.md)
  - Types:
    - [Singly Linked List](./data-structures/linear/linked-list/singly-linked-list.md)
    - [Doubly Linked List](./data-structures/linear/linked-list/doubly-linked-list.md)
    - [Circularly Linked List](./data-structures/linear/linked-list/circularly-linked-list.md)
    - [Doubly Circular Linked List](./data-structures/linear/linked-list/doubly-circular-linked-list.md)
- [Stack](./data-structures/linear/stack/stack.md)
  - [Java Stack](./data-structures/linear/stack/java-stack.md)
  - [Java Deque](./data-structures/linear/stack/java-deque.md)
  - [Java ArrayDeque](./data-structures/linear/stack/java-arraydeque.md)
- [Queue](./data-structures/linear/queue/queue.md)
  - [Java Queue Class](./data-structures/linear/queue/java-queue.md)
  - [Java PriorityQueue Class](./data-structures/linear/queue/java-priorityqueue.md)
  - Types:
    - [Priority Queue](./data-structures/linear/queue/priority-queue.md)

### Non-Linear
Elements are arranged in one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many dimensions.
- [Tree](./data-structures/non-linear/tree/tree.md)
- [Graph](./data-structures/non-linear/graph/graph.md)
