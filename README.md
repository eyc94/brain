## :round_pushpin: Data Structures
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. An efficient data structure utilizes minimum memory space and execution time.

There are two classifications of data structures:

### Linear
Elements are arranged in one dimension.
- [Array](./data-structures/linear/array.md)
  - [Java ArrayList](./data-structures/linear/java-arraylist.md)
- [Linked List](./data-structures/linear/linked-list.md)
  - [Java LinkedList](./data-structures/linear/java-linkedlist.md)
- [Stack](./data-structures/linear/stack.md)
- [Queue](./data-structures/linear/queue.md)

### Non-Linear
Elements are arranged in one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many dimensions.
- [Tree](./data-structures/non-linear/tree.md)
- [Graph](./data-structures/non-linear/graph.md)
